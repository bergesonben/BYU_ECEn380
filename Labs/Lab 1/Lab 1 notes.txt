1. How about an index that urns from 0 to 2*pi with 10 elements?
	0 0.6283 1.2566 1.8850 2.5133 3.1416 3.7699 4.3982 5.0265 5.6549 6.2832

2. Does index3 have 10 elements? 
	No, it has 11

3. Can you explain why index3 has 11 elements?
	Because it includes 0

4. What happened? Explain what this is doing in your lab book.
	It took row two through three and where it intersects with column two through three and replaces it with 0.5 0.5;0.7 0.7

5. Record practices (see screen shots)

6. Fig 1

7. What is the difference between the following two operations?
	the first one multiplies the matrix by itself. 
	The second one squares each element. 
	Fig 2

8. makes a higher pitch sound. Because it's a higher frequency

9. The (t > 3) and (t < 5) is acting like a filter. so any number above 5 and under threee would make s1 multiply by 0
